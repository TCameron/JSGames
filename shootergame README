README:

Thanks for playing my game! It was created in HTML 5 canvas and Javascript.
Included is a library called Victor.js, which I did not write.

Running the game:
Open shootergame.html in your browser of choice. Most modern browsers will support the game.

Rules:
You get 3 lives. You lose a life upon touching an enemy.
You can dodge enemies for 10 points each, or shoot them for 100 points.
See how many points you can rack up!
There is a pacifist score which is obtained if you never shoot an enemy.

Controls are as follows:
Arrows, WASD, Mouse: Move
J, Left Click: Fire regular shot
K, Middle Click: Use alternate ability
Esc: Pause and Unpause game
R: Restart game

Currently, there are a missile and a shield ship.
You have to manually edit the source code to switch between them.
On line 49, change:

var shipAbility = 1;

to

var shipAbility = 2;

1 is missile (The shot will penetrate enemies and give triple points)
2 is shield (Your ship will not blow up on contact, enemies will)

Features to come:

Options Menu - Will have the ability to change the types of ship that you play as, instead of editing source.
High Scores - Will allow you to track your high scores.
